Poem:

After the wind, the long length of the earth,
You can make him
a good man for the dead:
You can feel him in the dark.
You feel the dark.
You can see him in the dark.
You can feel him in the dark.
The black sky!
You can see him in the dark.
You may feel his face.
You’re an angel.

I’m the spirit, I’m the spirit, I’ve learned it.
I’m the spirit, I’m the spirit, he says,
And I’m the spirit that’s the spirit of my sister.
I’m the spirit, the spirit of a dead woman, I’m the spirit,
No doubt.
I’m the spirit of the dead, who’s the power of the dead.
I’m the spirit that made me say,
And I’m the spirit that’s the power of my mother.
My father has been killed.
My father says, in the time, I’m the spirit,
No doubt

In the darkness of the world where I’m an angel,
I don’t know how to be a spider, I don’t know how to be a spider. I’m a ghost,
I don’t know how to be a spider, I don’t know how to be a spider,
I don’t know how to be a spider. I’m a ghost,
I don’t know what I am thinking of. I’m a ghost,
I don’t know how to be a spider, I am a worm.
I don’t know how to be a spider. You’re a spider,
I don’t know how to be a spider.
I don’t know how to be a snake, I don’t know how to be a spider.
I don’t know how to be a spider, I’m a spider,
I don’t know how to be an angel.
I don’t know how to be an angel. I know how to be a fool
That can be a snake. I’m a snake
I don’t know how to be a spider, I don’t know what to be a snake,
I don’t know why to be a spider, I don’t know how to be a spider.
I don’t know how to be a spider, I don’t know how to be a spider
I don’t know how to be a snake. I’m a spider, I am an angel,
I don’t know how to be a spider. I am a snake, I am the worm, I am a spider, I am an animal.
I am a spider, I am an animal, I am a spider, I am a snake, I am a spider, I am a puppy. I am a fish, I am a turtle. I am a

Aunt Jane,

Who wants to take her, in the water,

Holds her the rest. And she will

Not quite me. But she will now

Put on a piece of her, and

Ah, dear Jane, who will

Walk to the door of a night house,

And then to the floor, to the ceiling,

To the wall of a porch,

Aunt Jane. And the
