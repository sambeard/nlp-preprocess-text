After the wind, the long length of the earth,
You can make him
a good man for the dead:
You can feel him in the dark.
You feel the dark.
You can see him in the dark.
You can feel him in the dark.
The black sky!
You can see him in the dark.
You may feel his face.
You’re an angel.

No doubt.
I’m the spirit of the dead, who’s the power of the dead.
I’m the spirit that made me say,
And I’m the spirit that’s the power of my mother.
My father has been killed.
My father says, in the time, I’m the spirit,
No doubt

Poem:

What’s in the woods,

No one’s business,

And not my own;

The good-greatest thing I love,

No one’s business,

No one’s ever a man.

And I’ve lived since I died,

The best is a woman.

I’ve had so long lost,

I’ve lost,

And I’ve been lost.

But, while I’ve done,

I’ve changed

What’s in the woods,

And I’ve been gone.

I’ve waited for,

But, by the time it’s done,

I’ve long to die,

And I’ve changed.

I’ve waited for,

And I’ve been taken.

I’ve come to the world again.

I’ve come to that world again.

It’s the only way for you.

I’ve come to that world again.

I’ve come to that world again.

I’ve been taken,

To that world again.

I’ve come to the world again.

I’ve come to some places.

I’ve long been taken.

I’ve come to your world again.

They’ve come to my world again.

They’ve come to the world again.

They’ve come to me,

And I’ve come to it again.

I’ve come to the world again.

They’ve come to the world again.

I’ve come to it again,

And I’ve come to it again.

I’ve come to it again.

I’ve come to it again.

By the way to your world again.

I’ve come to it again.

When I’ve come to the world again.

But I’ve come to you,

And I’ve come to it again.

But I’ve come to it again.

And I’ve come to it again.

In the end it’s the beginning,

And I’ve come to the world again.

I’ve come to it again.

I’ve come to it again.

It’s the beginning.

I’ve come to it again.

I’ve come to it again.

I’ve come to it again.

I’ve come to it again.

Some of us do not need you,

And I’ve come to it again.

My life and I’ve come to it again.

I’ve come to it again.

I’ve come to it again.

I can have thought of the world again.

I know of the world again.

I can have thought of the world again.

The world’s not the beginning of the world again.

I want to believe in the world again.

And I can never understand.

I don’t ask.

I came to a tall stack of tall steep down baskets,

A flimsy with the color of sky, and next to it

A carmine tea was filled with ice cream.

On the way out, the light was still on,

And my father was sitting on the floor

Like an apparition on a bed.

On the way out of the wall Mao swallowed Darwin,

The puncture of salt and satin,

The fat white liver had burning

In the face of a fish,

The fat white breast of a fish.

I took my jaw in two fingers,

And the back of a horse,

The black lap of a pig, the blue 

The black satin, the yellow pupil

Slimed like a microbeating steel,

And the blue cap of a man

And the white satin purse,

The black lap of a man

And the blue coat of a man,

The red shirt of a yellow 

Cocked back to his black loafers,

In the last scene Walt Whitman was walking home from school to the opera.

He was saying “Dullness,” and he asked me if I wanted to talk to him.

He didn’t know what. He said that his mother wanted to go out of his room.

“I want to talk to another person”— he said, “one person,” and he said, “look at you.

Do you understand what?” I asked. “Really, you know what?”

He said he said. “I want to talk to your emotional theory.”

I told him “you’re in the same poem.” I hadn’t read

such things. I tried to help him out. “Really,”

said he joked him. “Really?” He said he joked him

The wind blew over our faces, and we were out

but we were not pleased to catch it.

The wind beat over our faces,

so loud the wind would laugh, so loud

we fell to our knees,

The clouds rolled away, and we fell

The stars rose to our faces

And we fell to our knees,

The sea swells and carries its emptiness like a child who will never be free.

The beach goes in and looks at the sky.

The waves come in and in. Some of us will be left.

The sky pulses in and in.

The cliffs skip. A long time of space to shine.

The edges of the sea beat in and out.

The cliffs skip. We are far from here.

The cliffs look like cities. Some of us will look like cities.

The cities look like cities. Some of us will try to run

without knowing it. Some of us will suffer what we are forced

to keep us permanently apart.

The cliffs look like cities. Some of us will suffer.

A perfect figure in the middle

of the tunnel, an arrow brightening in the eye.

The trees look like cities. Some of us will suffer.

The cliffs look like cities. Some of us will suffer.

The cities dissolve in and out.

And the cliffs stand like cities.

The cities appear in and out.

Riding up the park

where the sun burned briefly for a long time.

I thought that the street was full of statues,

and the trees were so green and green, and the trees were brown

and the trees were green and blue and green thick, and the trees were

and the trees were lush and green and tall and tall and grand.

I wanted only to be back in a few years.

I wanted not to be here before I could see

those flowers I had not yet learned to aim.

I wanted only to be beautiful and vague.

I wanted to be gone on a long time.

I wanted to be gone on a long time now and have

a good time, a good time, a good time, a good time.

I wanted to be gone down sometimes.

In the so quiet of the space between us

I wanted to be happy with you,

for you, for you, for me, for me, for me,

for me, for me, for me.
