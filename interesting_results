Poem:

After the wind, the long length of the earth,
You can make him
a good man for the dead:
You can feel him in the dark.
You feel the dark.
You can see him in the dark.
You can feel him in the dark.
The black sky!
You can see him in the dark.
You may feel his face.
You’re an angel.

I’m the spirit, I’m the spirit, I’ve learned it.

And I’m the spirit that’s the spirit of my sister.
I’m the spirit, the spirit of a dead woman, I’m the spirit,
No doubt.
I’m the spirit of the dead, who’s the power of the dead.
I’m the spirit that made me say,
And I’m the spirit that’s the power of my mother.
My father has been killed.
My father says, in the time, I’m the spirit,
No doubt

I don’t know what I am thinking of. I’m a ghost,
I don’t know how to be a spider, I am a worm.
I don’t know how to be a spider. You’re a spider,
I don’t know how to be a spider.

I don’t know how to be a spider, I’m a spider,
I don’t know how to be an angel.
I don’t know how to be an angel. I know how to be a fool
That can be a snake. I’m a snake
I don’t know how to be a spider, I don’t know what to be a snake,
I don’t know why to be a spider, I don’t know how to be a spider.
I don’t know how to be a spider, I don’t know how to be a spider
I don’t know how to be a snake. I’m a spider, I am an angel,

To the wall of a porch,

Yet they, in the end of the year, made their own.

When they’ve come back to the house of the year,

I am not the one-eyed, blind, and sad.

Poem:

What’s in the woods,

No one’s business,

And not my own;

The good-greatest thing I love,

No one’s business,

No one’s ever a man.

And I’ve lived since I died,

The best is a woman.

I’ve had so long lost,

I’ve lost,

And I’ve been lost.

But, while I’ve done,

I’ve changed

What’s in the woods,

And I’ve been gone.

I’ve waited for,

But, by the time it’s done,

I’ve long to die,

And I’ve changed.

I’ve waited for,

And I’ve been taken.

I’ve come to the world again.

I’ve come to that world again.

It’s the only way for you.

I’ve come to that world again.

I’ve come to that world again.

I’ve been taken,

To that world again.

I’ve come to the world again.

I’ve come to some places.

I’ve long been taken.

I’ve come to your world again.

They’ve come to my world again.

They’ve come to the world again.

They’ve come to me,

And I’ve come to it again.

I’ve come to the world again.

They’ve come to the world again.

I’ve come to it again,

And I’ve come to it again.

I’ve come to it again.

I’ve come to it again.

By the way to your world again.

I’ve come to it again.

When I’ve come to the world again.

But I’ve come to you,

And I’ve come to it again.

But I’ve come to it again.

And I’ve come to it again.

In the end it’s the beginning,

And I’ve come to the world again.

I’ve come to it again.

I’ve come to it again.

It’s the beginning.

I’ve come to it again.

I’ve come to it again.

I’ve come to it again.

I’ve come to it again.

Some of us do not need you,

And I’ve come to it again.

My life and I’ve come to it again.

I’ve come to it again.

I’ve come to it again.

I can have thought of the world again.

I know of the world again.

I can have thought of the world again.

The world’s not the beginning of the world again.

I want to believe in the world again.

And I can never understand.

I don’t ask.

There is no room.


When we come to bed, we mean the room.


I mean to tell you where I ask the house.

It’s the darkest of the day,
and on in the dark of night,

it begins in a dark box to be lit—
like a handkerchief—
the night’s a dark mouse—

I am alone.
I am silent.
My darkness grows older,
not yet to go
to bed.
